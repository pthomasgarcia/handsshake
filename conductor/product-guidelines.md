# Product Guidelines - handsshake

## Tone and Style
- **Technical & Precise:** All documentation and user-facing messages must prioritize clarity, technical accuracy, and conciseness.
- **Direct Communication:** Use active voice and avoid fluff. Focus on explaining *how* the tool works and *how* to use it effectively.
- **Consistent Terminology:** Maintain strict consistency in naming conventions and technical terms (e.g., "agent," "socket," "lock," "timeout").

## Documentation Standards
- **Clarity Above All:** Instructions should be step-by-step and easy to follow for experienced developers and sysadmins.
- **Visual Examples:** Use code blocks and shell snippets liberally to demonstrate usage and configuration.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensure all features, configuration options, and troubleshooting steps are well-documented.

## User-Facing Messages (CLI)
- **Informative Errors:** Error messages should clearly state what went wrong and, if possible, how to fix it.
- **Minimal Verbosity:** By default, provide only essential output. Use the `--verbose` flag for more detailed information.
- **Standardized Output:** Ensure CLI output is consistent in format and easy to parse, both by humans and potentially by other scripts.
